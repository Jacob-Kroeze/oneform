# oneform
[demo](http://oneformacc.herokuapp.com/)

One form depends on a database with it's own migration management and
named functions for create and read access. For us,
this project is called bxt-migrations internally.

Oneform also depends on [JSONschema](http://jsonschema.org) and
[alpacajs](http://alpacajs.org) for form management and generation.

We use a separate project for documenting, managing, and testing these
schemas, and Oneform provides a mechanize for a GUI to create (TODO)
temporary or very simple schema/forms.

Complex schemas should be loaded to the schemas table by the
dba/developer within the migrations project (bxt-migrations), and effects of a schema change should be tested.

Oneform is the form display, api and database access layer, and
miscelaneous tie stuff together, "Glue", layer. This, all for a form
and data management system that can flexibly be applied to many
enterprisey problems in the HR and Contract management domain.

Nice sales pitch, huh :)
